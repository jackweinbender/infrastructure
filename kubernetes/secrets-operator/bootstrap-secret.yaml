# This file contains the definition of a Kubernetes Secret resource.
# You'll need to replace the values with your own secret data, encoded in base64.
# Initially, the secret data is empty but should be automatically populated by the secrets operator
# once the secrets operator is deployed and running.
#
# One way to bootstrap this would be to use your local 1password-cli to create and inject
# the secret data into the Kubernetes secret file before deploying the secrets operator,
# coupled with an `.env` file to inject the secret locally.
#
# For example:
# op run --env-file=.env -- kubectl apply -f bootstrap-secret.yaml
# Or export the OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN variable in your shell before running the command.
# Alternatively, you could incorporate this into a CI/CD pipeline to automate the process.
